    ### What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
    Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and 
    human (natural) languages. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

    NLP tasks include sentiment analysis, machine translation, text classification, and named entity recognition, among others. These tasks require a deep understanding of the 
    structure, meaning, and context of natural language, and they often involve complex algorithms and models that are trained on large amounts of data.

    NLP is an interdisciplinary field that draws on techniques from computer science, linguistics, mathematics, and psychology. It is used in a variety of applications, 
    including language translation, virtual assistants, and customer service chatbots, among others.
